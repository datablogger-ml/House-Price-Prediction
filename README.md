# House-Price-Prediction
Predicting the price of Houses using different features. Using multiple feature selection techniques to choose the best model

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to get familiar with Time Series Forecasting which is very helpful in univariate analysis, and is extensively used in Demand Forecasting. Time series forecasting uses the information in a time series to forecast future values of that series.

### Methods Used
* Regression Analysis - Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net
* Machine Learning
* Feature - Selection Techniques
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* sklearn
* Pandas, jupyter
* matplotlib

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

### Data

### Methods

#### 1. Regression 

In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables :

* <strong>Simple Linear Regression</strong> - 
* <strong>Multiple Linear Regression</strong> - 
* <strong>Polynomial</strong> -
* <strong>Lasso(L1 Regularization)</strong> - 
* <strong>Ridge(L2 Regularization)</strong> - 


#### 2. Feature Selection Techniques

* <strong>Correlation</strong> - 
* <strong>Reccursive Feature Elimination(RFE)</strong>
* <strong>Lasso Feature selection</strong>

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
